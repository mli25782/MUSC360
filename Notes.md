## At the court of Versailles, ca. 1687
### Palace of Versailles
The palace housed French court and government officials. King Louis XIV resided here and hosted lavish musical entertainments. The musical establishment consisted of 150-200 musicians divided into 3 divisions:
* Royal Chapel: singers/instrumentalists for church services
* Chamber: strings, winds, keyboards for indoor entertainment
  * Vingt-quatre (24) violons du Roi: Europe's first true orchestra (6 violins, 12 violas, 6 cellos, and some woodwinds)
  * Petits violons: smaller ensemble of 18 string players that performed at balls, dinners, and staged entertainment
* Great Stable: winds, brass, timpani players for outdoor events
### Ballet de cour (Court Ballet)
Most popular entertainment at Louis XIV's court at the time. Involved
* Staged, costumed spectacle that involves professional singers and dancers
* Plot that glorifies the King
* Usually carefully rehearsed
* Score consists of:
  * Dance entrees: (dance performed by professional dancers)
  * Vocal recits (solo/duet with continuo) and choruses (by professional singers)
  * Final grant ballet: extended dance sequence with audience participation
### Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-87)
Italian-born French composer at Louis XIV's court. Initially entered court service as a ballet de cour dancer but was eventually appointed as Louis XIV's court composer and director of Petits Violons in 1653. He was later promoted to Superintendant of Music for King's Chamber in 1661. Lully was known for his staged works **comedies-ballet** and **tragedies lyrique**. He was also granted a royal monopoly to compose opera in France, creating the first ever operatic canon.
#### Le bourgeois gentilhomme (1670)
Comedie-ballet that is a satire on social-climbing pretentious and greed. The music and dance was embedded into the plot:
* Chansons de boire (drinking songs) and popular air sung by characters
* Monsieur Jourdain's dance lessons included real court dances
* Play includes **divertissements** (intermedes between acts that is a scene of alternating dance entrees and vocal recits) but are usually somewhat related to the play

#### Tragedie Lyrique
5 act plot with an allegorical prologue glorifying the King. Plot based on merveilleaux (miraculous events and magic) which was an excuse to use special effects. Each act must include a divertissement that is loosely related to the plot. Poetic and musical influences include:
* Venetian opera: scene types
* Ballet de cour: majority of airs; choruses and dances
* Comedie-ballet: integration of divertissements into the plot
* Classical **French tragedy**: genre based on ancient Greek and Roman antiquity (Lully's contemporaries). Also brought dramatic, heightened speech.
**French recitative**: Lully's invention modeled after the drama Lully observed in French drama.

##### Armide (1686)
Lully's last tragedie lyrique that became the model of tragedie genre for the next century. The plot focuses on Armide and her love for crusader knight Renaud. Was known as **the ladies' opera** since the plot focused on the psychological development of female characters, which was unique at the time since most plots focused on a heroic male lead.

### Keyboard Suite
Keyboard arrangements of orchestral dances for private parties. Originally arranged for lute, but eventually **clavecin** (French harpsichord). Pieces preserved form, meter, rhythm, tempo, and other sylistic features of the original dance. However, these arrangements, were designed for listening, not dancing. Some stylistic notes:
* style brise (broken style): chords are arpeggiated to elongate the sound (imitate the lute)
* agrements (ornaments): again to imitate the lute.

#### Elizabeth-Claude Jacquet de la Guerre (1665-1729)
Virtuoso keyboardist who was a protege of King Louis XIV. Also wrote several operas, ballets, cantatas, keyboard suites, and solo/trio-sonatas.
##### Suite no. 3 in A-minor (1687)
A sequence of stylized keyboard dances, preceded by a prelude. Most dances are in binary with repeats (AABB). A modulates to V/III, B returns to I. The standard 4 dance sequence is
* allemande: moderate-tempo dance of German origins, featuring continuous motion in 8th 16ths
* courante ("running"): moderate-tempo frence dance with frequent hemiolas
* sarabande: slow-tempo dance of Spanish origins in triple meter with an emphasis on the 2nd beat.
* gigue: fast dance of English/Irish origins in compound triple meter.
* followed by several options : chaconne, gavotte, minuet
* chaconne: slow stately dance in triple time (similar to sarabande)
* gavotte: modern French dance in fast tempo. Less stylized with regular phrasing and melodic repetition. Contains a half-measure upbeat
* minuet: modern French dance in moderate tempo with regular phrasing and melodic repetition.

In practice, a performer could omit (but probably not reorder) movements.   
The suite also features a **prelude**: composed improvisatory movement that explores the main harmonic functions of the tonic key through arpeggiation.

### Instrumental sonata
Multi-movement chamber work
* Solo sonata: for calvecin with accompany treble instruments (violin, flute, oboe). 
* Trio-sonata: 2 treble instruments, a concerted bass instrument (e.g. cello, viola de gamba) and organ or clavecin continuo. In reality requires 4 players but the trio refers to the operatic trio texture created.
#### Trio-Sonata no. 4 in G-minor (1695)
Written by Elizabeth-Claude Jacquet de la Guerre for 2 violins, concerted cello, and continuo. Consists of 8 movements organized by
* Tempo contrast: slow-fast (Grave, Presto, [Adagio], Presto, Adagio, Presto, Aria/Adagio, Allgero)
* Texture contrast: homophonic slow movements in trio texture with dissonant suspensions versus imitative/fugal fast movements
